<p><figure style="text-align:right;"><img src="/images/img.png" alt="check the image" width="200" height="200"> </figure>A farmer is a person engaged in agriculture, raising living organisms for food or raw materials.[1] The term usually applies to people who do some
    combination of raising field crops, orchards, vineyards, poultry, or other livestock. A farmer might own the farmland or might work as a laborer on
    land owned by others. In most developed economies, a "farmer" is usually a farm owner (landowner), while employees of the farm are known as farm workers
    (or farmhands). However, in other older definitions a farmer was a person who promotes or improves the growth of plants, land, or crops or raises animals
    (as livestock or fish) by labor and attention.</p>

<p>More distinct terms are commonly used to denote farmers who raise specific domesticated animals. For example, those who raise grazing livestock, such as cattle,
    sheep, goats and horses, are known as ranchers (U.S.),<a href="https://www.vecteezy.com/free-vector/farmer-working"> gaurav</a> graziers (Australia & UK) or simply stockmen. Sheep, goat and cattle farmers might also be referred to,
    respectively, as shepherds, goatherds and cowherds. The term dairy farmer is applied to those engaged primarily in milk production, whether from cattle, goats,
    sheep, or other milk producing animals. A poultry farmer is one who concentrates on raising chickens, turkeys, ducks or geese, for either meat,
    egg or feather production, or commonly, all three. A person who raises a variety of vegetables for market may be called a truck farmer or market gardener.
    Dirt farmer is an American colloquial term for a practical farmer, or one who farms his own land.[9]

In developed nations,<figure ><img src="/images/img_3.png" alt="check the image" width="200" height="200"><figcaption>gaurav</figcaption></figure> a farmer (as a profession) is usually defined as someone with an ownership interest in crops or livestock, and who provides land
    or management in their production. Those who provide only labor are most often called farmhands. Alternatively, growers who manage farmland for an absentee landowner,
    sharing the harvest (or its profits) are known as sharecroppers or sharefarmers. In the context of agribusiness, a farmer is defined broadly, and thus many
    individuals not necessarily engaged in full-time farming can nonetheless legally qualify under agricultural policy for various subsidies, incentives,
    and tax deductions.</p>

Beneath the rising amber sun,
He walks the fields, his day begun.
With soil-stained hands and weathered face,
He moves with quiet, steady grace.

The plow, the seed, the morning dew,
He knows what patience must go through.
Each furrow tells a tale of toil,
A prayer is planted in the soil.

Through storms that lash and droughts that sear,
He labors on, through hope and fear.
His harvest—more than food or grain—
Is courage born from loss and gain.

No spotlight shines upon his name,
No medals mark his noble aim.
Yet every loaf and grain we eat
Begins beneath his humble feet.

So when you see the fields of gold,
Remember stories left untold—
Of one who gives with silent worth,
The farmer—heart and soul of Earth.</pre></blockquote>
