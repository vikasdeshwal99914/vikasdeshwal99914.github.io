    <q style="font-size:370%">Health Benefits of Ghee</q>

<p style="font-size:140%">Rich in Healthy Fats
Ghee is a source of saturated fats that can provide energy and support hormone production. In moderation, it helps improve fat metabolism.

High Smoke Point
Ghee has a high smoke point (~485°F / 250°C), making it ideal for frying and sautéing without producing harmful free radicals.

Lactose & Casein-Free
Most of the dairy proteins and sugars are removed during the clarification process, making it easier to digest for people with lactose intolerance.

Supports Digestion
In Ayurveda, ghee is considered good for the gut. It stimulates the secretion of stomach acids, helping with digestion.

Rich in Fat-Soluble Vitamins
Ghee contains Vitamins A, D, E, and K, which are essential for immunity, bone health, skin, and vision.

Contains Butyrate (Butyric Acid)
A short-chain fatty acid that supports gut health, reduces inflammation, and may improve colon function.

Boosts Immunity
The antioxidants in ghee help neutralize free radicals and support overall immune function.

Good for Skin
Used topically, ghee helps moisturize and heal dry or inflamed skin. It's often used in Ayurvedic beauty treatments.

Promotes Weight Loss (in moderation)
The healthy fats in ghee can help mobilize stubborn fat and support metabolism when used correctly.

Brain Health
Ghee nourishes the brain and nervous system, and it's often used in traditional practices to enhance memory and concentration.</p>

<pre style="color:#2F0909;"><h1 style="font-size:375%;"><ins>How To Make Ghee At Home?</ins></h1>
<p style="font-size:150%;">While you know about ghee uses and various benefits of ghee, learn the simple procedure to make ghee at home.
    Making ghee at home is highly beneficial and comparatively cheaper than buying a jar of ghee at the market.
    While it is easy to make, there are high chances of burning it if you do not monitor it properly.
The best way to prepare ghee is from homemade butter. Homemade butter is prepared from the cream of milk or malai.
    The advantage of using cream to prepare ghee is that you get three end products: ghee, butter, and buttermilk.
Make sure your cream is rich and of good quality, and follow this in-depth recipe for preparing ghee at home.
Be sure to use cold cream when you make ghee
Churn the cream thoroughly in a large bowl for a few minutes
Continue churning until you see the butter and liquid separate
Make sure that the cream has separated completely
Cover a sieve with a thin cotton cloth and place it on the bowl
Drain the butter on the cloth and the liquid buttermilk in the container
Squeeze the cloth to ensure that the liquid is removed completely
Place the freshly prepared butter in a pan and keep it on the stove Melt the butter completely
Simmer the butter and cook it for at least 20-25 minutes
Stir intermittently to ensure that ghee does not burn
Cook ghee until the color of ghee changes from a bright yellow color to a light golden-brown color
Stop cooking when you get clear ghee and brownish milk solids at the bottom
Cool the ghee and transfer it into an airtight jar after straining the milk solids
Now that you are aware of the umpteen benefits of ghee, do not hesitate to include it in your diet.
    It is one of the healthiest foods to have, but make sure that you are eating pure ghee.
    This is what offers all the goodness that boosts your health. However, if you face any health issues or
    have diet constraints, talk to doctors and specialists on Bajaj Finserv Health. Book a tele-consult or
    in-person appointment and address all your health concerns with ease.</p>
