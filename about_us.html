<h1><ins >farmer in india</ins></h1>
<p>A farmer is a person engaged in agriculture, raising living organisms for food or raw materials.
    The term usually applies to people who do some combination of raising field crops, orchards, vineyards,
    poultry, or other livestock. A farmer might own the farmland or
    might work as a laborer on land owned by others.</p>

    For example, those who raise grazing livestock, such as cattle, sheep, goats and horses,
    are known as ranchers (U.S.), graziers (Australia & UK) or simply stockmen. Sheep, goat and
    cattle farmers might also be referred to, respectively, as shepherds, goatherds and cowherds.
    The term dairy farmer is applied to those engaged primarily in milk production, whether from cattle,
    goats, sheep, or other milk producing animals. A poultry farmer is one who concentrates on raising chickens,
    turkeys, ducks or geese, for either meat, egg or feather production, or commonly, all three. A person who raises
    a variety of vegetables for market may be called a truck farmer or market gardener. Dirt farmer is
    an American colloquial term for a practical farmer, or one who farms his own land.[9]
In developed nations, a farmer (as a profession) is usually defined as someone with an ownership interest
    in crops or livestock, and who provides land or management in their production. Those who provide only labor
    are most often called farmhands. Alternatively, growers who manage farmland for an absentee landowner, sharing
    the harvest (or its profits) are known as sharecroppers or sharefarmers. In the context of agribusiness, a farmer
    is defined broadly, and thus many individuals not necessarily engaged in full-time farming can nonetheless
    legally qualify under agricultural policy for various subsidies, incentives, and tax deductions.</p>

    Beneath the sun's relentless gaze,
Through chilly dawns and dusky haze,
A humble soul with calloused hand,
Tends to life across the land.

With plow and hope, he breaks the ground,
Where silent seeds are gently found.
He speaks in silence, sweat, and soil
A quiet poem of honest toil.

The rains may come, or hold their peace,
The winds may rage, the crops may cease,
Yet still he wakes before the light,
To chase again the harvest's rite.</pre>
